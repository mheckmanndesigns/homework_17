                <h2>Hey There! I'm Michele!</h2>
                <p>I am a UI/UX Designer who loves to bridge the gap between the human and the technical sides of
                    customer needs. With over 10 years in User Experience research, I can help you uncover those deep
                    seated customer needs.
                </p>

                <p> Pairing my certification in UI/UX Design from Georgia Tech with my Bachelors in Business
                    Administration and Computer Information Systems, I have the unique ability to understand and
                    translate business needs into technical requirements using proven design thinking approaches.
                </p>

                <p>When I’m not digging into the why you can find me in my studio, sewing handmade quilts, bags and
                    purses or giving forlorn furniture new life through painting and other techniques. I live with the
                    love of my life and our two fur babies in Marietta, GA.

                <div class="col">
                    <p>THE PROBLEM: Business travelers need to find ways to relax in
                        their downtime while on the road. Traditional travel apps don’t
                        address short term needs of business travelers looking for quick
                        activities.

                <div class="col">
                    <p>THE SOLUTION: Develop a concept application that addresses the pain
                        points of business travelers by providing access to quick, local
                        events and activities that can be explored in downtime between
                        meetings.

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <h4>Why We Need to Interview</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sixty percent of todays travelers report that they are engaging in 'bleisure' (business + Leisure)
                    travel to help reduce stress and stay more relaxed while they are away from home.</li>
                <li>Both travelers and business owners have a need to understand this type of trsvel and it's impact.

                </li>
                <li>To unerstand how and when 'bleisure' travel is planned, frequent business travelers will be
                    interviewed to understand their feelings towards 'bleisure' travel, how they currently book business
                    travel and the challenges that are faced when trying to add leisure activities to a business trip.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>User Interviews and Surveys</h4>
            <p>The user interviews and surveys targeted frequent business travelers (2+ per month) and focused on how
                they currently book business travel, what motivates them to add leisure travel and what challenges they
                face trying to combine the two. The research found:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Business travelers spend considerably less time planning business trips than personal trips. </li>
                <li>Business travelers prefer personal recommendations and reviews for suggestions over travel sites.
                </li>
                <li>Business travelers have a hard time finding activities tailored to their schedules and preferences
                    when on the road.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>User Persona</h4>
            <p>Through the use of Affinty diagrams and Empathy Maps, a user persona was developed to define the typical
                business traveler that would have a need to seek out 'bleisure' travel options.</p>

            <h3>DEFINITION & IDEATION</h3>
            <h4>User Insight</h4>
            <p>I am a busy business traveler looking for ways to unwind between meetings so I csn be freah for my next
                meeting. However, I am unable to easily find activities that match both my interests and time frames and
                researching on my own just adds to my stress.</p>

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>By creating a problem statement, reviewing the competition and evaluating the research through "I Like, I
                Want and I Wish" activities, the purpose of the application became clear - "break the business travel
                routine and build your own adventures". Using this value proposition, the feeatures that bring the most
                value are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A simple registration process</li>
                <li>Knowing where the traveler is and how much free time they have</li>
                <li>Provide recommendations that match the traveler's personality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Creating storyboards of the the two main functions - Finding Activities and Earning Points - illustrated
                how and why a potential user would interact with the application.</p>

            <p>Creating hand drawn low-fidelity prototypes allowed me to create a quick and easy prototype to test my
                initial theories before beginning a low-fidelity prototype. The low-fidelity prototypes would be used to
                test the flow with potential users.

            <p>This Adobe XD low-fidelity clickable prototype was used to test the application iwth real user to

        <div class="row testbody">
            <h3>TESTING & ITERATION</h3>
            <P>In testing, potential user where asked to complete the following tasks: </P>
            <ul>
                <li>Register as a new user</li>
                <li>Schedule a trip to Seattle, WA for October 12-15</li>
                <li>Find an actiivity that interested them and add it to their calendar</li>

            </ul>
            <p>This round of user testing proved that some things worked well and that other things needed further
                refinement before moving on.</p>
            <ul>Successes
                <li>The onboarding process is clear and familiarizes the use with the functionality of the app</li>
                <li>The Sign Up process was simple and doesn't ask for too much information up front</li>
                <li>The Travel Style quiz is easy and fast</li>
                <li>The users appreciated the reminders and calendar functionality built into the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The opportunities that were discovered centers around changes to the onboarding experience, the
                login/sign up process and the expereince in creating a trip.</p>

            <ul>Onboarding
                <li>Even though the onboarding process was clear, redesigning the process can eliminate clicks, thereby
                    enhancing the user experience</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Log In/Sign Up
                <li>Visually differentitiating the buttons will make it easier for users to log in or sign up quickly
                </li>
                <li>Add a user id/password reset page for returning users </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Trip Creation
                <li>Update the user flow so that information previously entered doesn't have to be repeated</li>
                <li>Clarify the actions on each page to ensure users know what they can do on each page</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>iOS Mockups and Testing</h3>
            <P>High fidelity mockups of the application incorporating the iOS standards were created and another round
                of testing was completed wit potential travelers. </P>
            <img src="Images/ShowMe iOS Mockup.png" alt="iOS Mockup screens" width="300" height="200">


            <h3>Final Thoughts and Future Look</h3>
            <p>In this round of testing,the focus was on determining
                if business travelers culd find activities based on their personal preferences and time frames. The
                testing proved that the changes to the application allowed both of those objectives were met. The
                prototype received posiitive feedbsck during the testing and many business travelers comments that they
                struggle to find quality ctivities while traveling and this application would be somethng that they
                would download and use. If this application would continue into development, the following
                recommendations should be considered to enhance the user expereince: </P>
            <ul>
                <li>Social Media integration to allow sharing and to reach out and connect with your network while
                    traveling</li>
                <li>Conitnue to enhance the points and reward systems. Further research shuld be conducted to determine
                    what types of rewards and challenges would be considered a vlaue to the users</li>
                <li>Further refinement of the interface to procvide a seamless expereince between the ShowMe app and the
                    users personal and business calendars</li>
            </ul>
